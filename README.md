## Getting Started

Welcome to Notepad--.
A creative use of limited knowlegde of javafx to write files just like in notepad.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: javafx

## Dependency Management
You will need javafx lib for this. Which is included in lib folder. Change .vscode/launch.json with the location
of your javafx lib. and run it. ^_^
